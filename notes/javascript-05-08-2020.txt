JavaScript:

  HTML,CSS we can develop a static webpage. 
 
  For that static webpage(html web page) to bring dynamic nature JavaScript.

  JavaScript is scripting language. 

  Programming Language -> requires compilation
  Scripting Language -> interpreted language

  to bring life to a static webpage.


  Intially -> LiveScript.
   
  LiveScript -> JavaScript.


 JavaScript as client side scripting language.

  We execute JavaScript on browser.

  Allmost all the Browsers consists of scripting engines.

  Multiple JavaScript engines are available in market.

  Chorme -> V8 engine
  IE -> Chakra
  Mozilla -> SpiderMonkey
  Opera -> V8
  

  JavaScript -> ECMAScript 

  1999-2000

   era -> virus scripting. 



 W3C -> ECMAScript 


  JavaScript intially was developed only in 10 days, to validate the data a client     side.

  ECMAScript -> 11th Version.

   1 ->,5,6 11


 Fundamental of Scripting Language.

    Variable declaration.
    Datatypes.
    conditional and control statements
    functions
    Different of functions.
    Arrays
    

    OO in JavaScript



  To learn java, use tool, VisualStudioCode editor.


  Download and install VisualStudioCode.

  In a webpage we write javascript inside <scritp> tag
  or else we can write javascript in scripting file with extension ".js"
 

  Declaration of variable:

     var variable_name; -> before ECMAScript 5 version.

     From ECMAScript 5:
            var variable_name;
            let variable_name;


    let keyword is bound with the scope.

      {
          var x;
      }

      variable x can be used inside and outside of the block of also.

      {
          let x;
      }

      variable x can be used only inside the block.



   in javascript semicolons are optional, but it is highly recommended to use semicolons.




 Datatypes:

    JavaScript is dynamically datatype scripting language.

    Java -> datatype (int,float,double,boolean,etc...)

         int x ; I can intialize only integer values to x.


    var num;

    num = 10;
    num = 10.0
    num = "10"
    num = '1';
    num = 1;
    num = true;

    3. Output on browser console.



 Intialization:
====================


number,boolean,string,date,array

predefined values:
     null          -> reference
     undefined     -> primitive dataype
     NAN -> not a number
     Infinity 

Operators:
   
   Arithmatic (+,-,*,/,%)
   comparisional or relation operators
      >,<,>=,<=,==,!=,  ===
   logical operators (&&, ||, !)
   terinary operators. (condition?expression1:expression2)

  
+ (addition/concation)

   
Conditional:
   if,else,if-else-if,nested-if, switch

control:
   for,nested-for,while,do-while, for-in, for-of
